# Photouploader

## That is this?

This project is a file upload Web applicaion based on Spring Boot. It was created to collect photos and videos from attendees of my wedding. The final storage location is assumed to be a NAS (Network Attached Storage). Therefore, when running the JAR file, you need to provide the path to the network drive along with the username and password.

java -jar your-spring-boot-app.jar --my.custom.path=/path/to/your/directory
